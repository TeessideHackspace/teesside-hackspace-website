  <p><strong>Teesside Hackspace is entirely funded by your membership subscriptions &amp; donations.</strong></p>
  <p>We've taken a massive leap in moving to our new space, and we're currently
    making a monthly loss and burning through our cash reserves.
    We can't spend more money on making the space more awesome until we're making a monthly surplus.</p>
