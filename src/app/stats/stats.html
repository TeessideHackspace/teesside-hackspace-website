  <p><strong>Teesside Hackspace is entirely funded by your membership subscriptions &amp; donations.</strong></p>
  <p>We've taken a massive leap in moving to our new space, and we're currently
    making a monthly loss and burning through our cash reserves.
    We can't spend more money on making the space more awesome until we're making a monthly surplus.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong class="large"><a href="/members">Join Teesside Hackspace today!</a></strong> You'll get 24/7 access, a storage box for your projects, and warm fuzzy feelings for supporting us. We need members to pay an average £15/month for the space to survive.</li>
      <li>If you're already a member, <strong class="large">increase your monthly subscription payment</strong> by a few pounds.</li>
      <li>Volunteer to run a workshop on your area of expertise, or help us keep our infrastructure in shape.</li>
      <li>Let us know if there's something you'd like added to or changed in the Hackspace that would convince you to pay more each month.</li>
