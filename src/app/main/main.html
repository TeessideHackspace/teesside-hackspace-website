    Teesside Hackspace is a members-owned non-profit association. Members have a hand in the running of the
    organisation as well as 24/7 access to the space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Membership can be paid monthly or annually by Direct Debit. We ask that you pay what you think the space will be
    worth to you.
    Please be as generous as you can, Teesside Hackspace is currently funded entirely by membership dues & donations.
    We're currently <a href="/stats">making a loss</a> and burning through our cash reserves to finance our new space.
    Our recommended minimum subscription is £15/month. For students, retirees or low income members the minimum subscription is £5/month.
