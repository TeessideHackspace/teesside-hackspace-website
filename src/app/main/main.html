    Teesside Hackspace is a members-owned non-profit association. Members have a hand in the running of the
    organisation, and will have 24/7 access to the space once we get one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Membership can be paid monthly or annually by Direct Debit. We ask that you pay what you think the space will be
    worth to you.
    Please be as generous as you can, the more money we raise through membership, the better the space we get can
    be.
    The space will require our members to contribute an average subscription of £15/month to survive. For students,
    retirees or low income members the minimum subscription is £5/month.
